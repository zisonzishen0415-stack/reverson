# Installing ZDLs With Zoom Effect Manager

The release `.ZDL` files are in [../dist/](../dist/). Use
[Zoom Effect Manager](https://zoomeffectmanager.com/en/download/) 2.3.3 or
newer and point it at that folder.

## Steps

1. Connect the pedal first, then open Zoom Effect Manager.
2. Open `Settings`.
3. Choose `Read Effects from folder`.
4. Select this repo's `dist/` folder.

5. In the effect source/filter area, enable `Effects from devices`.
6. Enable `From Folder`.
7. Add the desired custom effects and write them to the pedal.

## Notes

Back up your current effect list before writing. Current release effects target
ZDL-based MultiStomp pedals and are only hardware-tested on MS-70CDR firmware
2.10 so far.

If an effect does not appear, confirm that Zoom Effect Manager is reading the
same `dist/` folder shown in this repo and that the `From Folder` source is
enabled.

On MS-70CDR firmware 2.10, a Drive-category custom effect can flash correctly
but stay hidden in the pedal's on-device FX browser if no stock Drive effect is
installed. If `ToTape9.ZDL` writes successfully but does not appear while
scrolling effects, also install at least one stock Drive effect. With a stock
Drive effect present, the custom Drive effect has been reported visible.
